# GuitarReader
GuitarReader is an explorative visual analysis tool for guitar players developed with d3.js. This tool takes advantage of Fishman TriplePlay's ability to convert all 6 guitar strings into seperate MIDI channels. Therefore, for using this tool you'll need the TriplePlay MIDI Controller and boot the device in Hardware mode.

This is part of my Bachelor Thesis under the Supervision of Michael Sedlmair at the University of Vienna.
